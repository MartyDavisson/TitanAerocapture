Abstract:
Saturnâ€™s moon Titan presents a unique opportunity in the realm of space exploration. It has intrigued scientists around the world with enticing tales as a potential site for life outside our home planet Earth. As the only moon in our solar system with a substantial atmosphere, future missions to Titan have the option to utilize aerocapture to increase fuel, mass and cost savings by a substantial margin. Aerocapture is achieved by using the vehicles aerodynamics to slow the vehicle rather than expending propellant. This paper will analyze several aspects of interest to future aerocapture missions on Titan including atmospheric heating and potential propellant savings. In addition, it provides an in-depth analysis into the optimization of the trajectory and final science orbits achieved through aerocapture maneuvers.
